            <h1>All about Dandelions</h1>
            <p>"Though dandelion today is considered by most people to be a useless weed, in truth
                it is one of the most beneficial and healthful of herbs. Every part of the dandelion has a use,
                ranging from food, to medicine, to dye. These beneficial properties did not always go unnoticed in
                North America: Up until the 1800s, people would actually pull grass out of their yards to make room
                for dandelions and other useful "weeds" such as chickweed, malva, and chamomile."(1)

    <div class="quote">"One popular legend ascribes dandelion's birth to the work of fairies. Many thousands 
        of years ago, when the world was populated with fairies and elves, the first human arrived. They soon caused 
        these tiny creatures many problems, as the humans were usually unable to see the wee folk and would 
        step on them. So the fairies took to dressing in bright yellow garments and eventually were changed into 
        dandelions, which have the ability to spring back up if trodden upon. Thus, it is believed that 
        dandelions recover so quickly from being stepped on because each contains the spirit of a fairy"(1)</div>
